# Welcome to NoirLens!

NoirLens is a browser extension designed to help you take control of your online habits by applying a grayscale filter to websites. I initially intended it to be specifically for social media platforms, but users can decide to apply it to whatever webpage they like. With NoirLens, you can reduce distractions, enhance focus, and create a more serene browsing experience.

## üöÄ Features in Development:

- **Grayscale Filtering**: Apply a sleek grayscale filter to your favorite websites, making them less visually stimulating and more calming.
- **Toggle Functionality**: Add or remove websites from your grayscale filter list effortlessly, giving you complete control over which sites are affected.
- **Settings Menu**: See your full list of sites, remove sites from toggle list.
- **Time Block**: Lock websites to be filtered for an hour, a day, or maybe even a week!

## üåê Current Availability:

NoirLens is currently being developed exclusively for **Chromium-based browsers** (like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge). However, I plan to expand support to other browsers in the near future, so stay tuned!

## üì¶ Installation:

NoirLens will be on the Chrome Web Store soon!


Thank you for visiting NoirLens! Enjoy a more focused browsing experience!
